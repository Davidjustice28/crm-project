# SimpleCrm - A simple contact relations manager

## This crm was created to see how my vanilla javascript skills have grown
I hope that it shows my ability to create CRUD applications.
The web application allows users to create, review, update, and delete contacts.You can also favorite contacts to add them to your hotlist for easy access.

*currently working on building a todo-list like feature for adding reminders*

I need to finish the following:
1. Buils reminders completion button functionality
2. Update styling
3. Add local storage
